A Rotating Game Object 







🧑‍💻 Coding Challenge 05 🎮

Challenge Accepted! 🚀 In this Unity coding challenge, I successfully created a small script that allows a game object to dynamically rotate around its own axis. The rotation can be customized along the x, y, or z axis, adding a dynamic element to the game. 🔄💡

This challenge not only honed my scripting skills but also enhanced my understanding of Unity game development. 🌐🎮
